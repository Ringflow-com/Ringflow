# Responsive Login Form

## Summary

This is a simple and responsive login form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes fields for email and password and a login button. It also features basic error message handling and a signup link for users who don't yet have an account. The form is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adjust to different screen sizes and devices.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Form Fields**: Includes fields for users to input their email and password.
- **Login Button**: A button that triggers the login action when clicked.
- **Error Handling**: Placeholder for error messages if the login fails (JavaScript integration can be added for dynamic error messages).
- **Signup Link**: A link to navigate users to the signup page if they don’t have an account.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the login form.
- `styles.css`: A CSS file for styling the login form and ensuring it's responsive.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file that can be used to handle form validation and error messages.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Ensure that the `styles.css` and `script.js` files are linked correctly for styling and functionality.

### Example

Here is a basic structure of the login form in the `index.html` file:

```html
